# ðŸ’¾ CHIP-8 Simulator
This is a CHIP-8 simulator written in **Rust**, based on the book "Rust In Action".

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed in the mid-1970s to run games on home computers. It is not a true processor, but rather a set of virtual instructions that can be run on a variety of platforms.

This simulator allows you to run CHIP-8 programs on your computer. It includes a simple debugger and a graphical display, so you can see what the program is doing in real time.

To use the simulator, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. You can find instructions for installing Rust at the official [Rust Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and build the simulator by running:

```rust
cargo build --release
```
